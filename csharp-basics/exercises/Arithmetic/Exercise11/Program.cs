//            A Harshad number is a number which is divisible by the sum of its digits.For example, 132 is divisible by 6(1 + 3 + 2).

//A subset of the Harshad numbers are the Moran numbers. Moran numbers yield a prime when divided by the sum of their digits.
//                For example, 133 divided by 7(1 + 3 + 3) yields 19, a prime.

//Create a function that takes a number and returns "M" if the number is a Moran number, "H" if it is a(non - Moran) Harshad number, or "Neither".

//Examples:
//  Moran(132) ➞ "H"
//  Moran(133) ➞ "M"
//  Moran(134) ➞ "Neither"

            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
