//                is underweight, or is overweight.A sedentary person's weight is considered optimal if his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. 
//                If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered underweight. 
//                If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered overweight.
