//Then display the contents of both arrays.To get the output to look like this, you'll need a several for loops.

//Create an array of ten integers
//Fill the array with ten random numbers(1 - 100)
//Copy the array into another array of the same capacity
//Change the last value in the first array to a - 7
//Display the contents of both arrays
//Array 1: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 - 7
//Array 2: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50
